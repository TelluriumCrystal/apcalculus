# AP Calculus CSV Reader
A Java program that reads .csv files with time and position data and then calculates velocity and acceleration. It graphs the calculated data and lists important data points.

The program will consist of four main parts: the .csv reader, the derivative calculator, the data display, and the GUI front-end. All four parts will be housed in their own class files, and can be worked on independantly. The following are the public methods and returns that each class should have.

1. Derivative calculator
- public static readcsv(String filename, String filepath) : should process the .csv file at the specified location
- public int[] return
